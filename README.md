# Dweller_Revisit
This is a revisited version of my project "Dweller". 

I made a lot of mistakes early in the project. It would take me more time to patch them out of the game and rewrite all the code.
Along with these mistakes I also decided at the time to NOT make the code robust or abstract at al. This resulted in code dependencies everywhere.
